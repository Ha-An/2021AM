# Introduction
* The code has been developed to evaluate the performance of 3D printing for decomposed 3D models. 
* This work is part of the part decomposity study [[Oh et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2020.101702)]


# Prerequisites
* [BLENDER 2.82](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-82/) -> **It must be Ver2.82**
* [V-HACD](https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd)

# Usage
* The Python code of "Evaluation_indicators" is run in the script embedded in Blender 2.82
